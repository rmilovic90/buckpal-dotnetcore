# Buckpal

This is a reference application which shows how to apply a domain-centric "Hexagonal" approach when designing .NET Core based solutions written in C# language.

The code presented here is the .NET Core port of the [Buckpal Java solution](https://github.com/thombergs/buckpal) which Tom Hombergs used as the companion code to his book: [Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture: A hands-on guide to creating clean web applications with code examples in Java](https://reflectoring.io/book/).
